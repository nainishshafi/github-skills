# github-skills

A collection of Claude Code skills stored in `.github/skills/`, providing reusable workflows for common development tasks.

## Skills

### `scan-repo-readme`
Efficiently locate and extract information from repository README files. Uses a lightweight subagent to perform dual-phase search (keyword + semantic) and writes results to a timestamped file.

**Trigger phrases:** "scan the readme", "search the readme for X", "what does the readme say about Y", "summarize the readme"

### `sync-github-forks`
Syncs all your GitHub forked repositories — clones missing ones and pulls existing ones. Uses the `gh` CLI for authentication, no token config needed.

**Trigger phrases:** "sync github forks", "sync forks", "pull all my forks"

**Prerequisites:** `gh` CLI (authenticated), `jq`, `git`, SSH key added to GitHub

### `skill-creator`
Scaffolds and writes new Claude Code skills following established conventions. Handles both reference/knowledge skills (rich documentation) and task/action skills (step-by-step workflows with scripts). Includes a Python script that generates the folder and boilerplate files.

**Trigger phrases:** "create a new skill", "add a skill", "write a skill", "scaffold a skill", "build a skill"
