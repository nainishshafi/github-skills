# github-skills

A collection of Claude Code skills stored in `.github/skills/`, providing reusable workflows for common development tasks.

## Skills

### `scan-repo-readme`
Efficiently locate and extract information from repository README files. Uses a lightweight subagent to perform dual-phase search (keyword + semantic) and writes results to a timestamped file.

**Trigger phrases:** "scan the readme", "search the readme for X", "what does the readme say about Y", "summarize the readme"

### `sync-github-forks`
Syncs all your GitHub forked repositories — clones missing ones and pulls existing ones. Uses the `gh` CLI for authentication, no token config needed.

**Trigger phrases:** "sync github forks", "sync forks", "pull all my forks"

**Prerequisites:** `gh` CLI (authenticated), `jq`, `git`, SSH key added to GitHub

### `skill-creator`
Scaffolds and writes new Claude Code skills following established conventions. Handles both reference/knowledge skills (rich documentation) and task/action skills (step-by-step workflows with scripts). Includes a Python script that generates the folder and boilerplate files.

**Trigger phrases:** "create a new skill", "add a skill", "write a skill", "scaffold a skill", "build a skill"

### `python-linter`
Runs ruff (lint + format) and optionally mypy (type checking) on Python code. Auto-fixes what it can and reports remaining issues with file and line references.

**Trigger phrases:** "lint python", "run the linter", "fix linting errors", "run ruff", "format python code", "check types", "run mypy"

**Prerequisites:** Python on PATH — skill creates `.venv` and installs `ruff`/`mypy` automatically

### `github-security-scanner-hook`
Scans staged files for secrets and code-level security vulnerabilities before every git commit. Language-agnostic — works with Python, JavaScript, Go, Ruby, and more. Uses `detect-secrets` for credential/key detection and `semgrep` with 20 bundled rules for injection flaws, XSS, path traversal, and other OWASP patterns. Can install a git pre-commit hook to automate scanning on every commit.

**Trigger phrases:** "scan for security vulnerabilities", "check for secrets in code", "set up a pre-commit security hook", "scan staged files for secrets", "check for hardcoded credentials", "detect leaked API keys", "scan for SQL injection", "check for XSS vulnerabilities"

**Prerequisites:** Python on PATH — skill creates `.venv` and installs `detect-secrets` and `semgrep` automatically
