# Python Linter

Run ruff (lint + format) and optionally mypy (type checking) on Python code. Auto-fixes what it can and reports what needs manual attention.

## Prerequisites

- Python project with `.py` files

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Set Up `.venv`

Always use `.venv` — create it if it doesn't exist:

```bash
[ -d .venv ] || python -m venv .venv
PYTHON=$(if [ -f .venv/Scripts/python ]; then echo .venv/Scripts/python; else echo .venv/bin/python; fi)
```

Install ruff into the venv if not already present:

```bash
$PYTHON -m ruff --version 2>/dev/null || $PYTHON -m pip install ruff
```

Optionally install mypy for type checking:

```bash
$PYTHON -m mypy --version 2>/dev/null || $PYTHON -m pip install mypy
```

Check for an existing `pyproject.toml` or `ruff.toml` config. If neither exists, offer to create a sensible default (see `references/python-linter-reference.md` for the recommended config).

### Step 2 — Run Ruff Lint (with auto-fix)

```bash
$PYTHON -m ruff check --fix .
```

- `--fix` auto-corrects safe issues (unused imports, style violations, etc.)
- Note any remaining violations that require manual fixes
- If the user wants to see all issues first without fixing:
  ```bash
  $PYTHON -m ruff check .
  ```

### Step 3 — Run Ruff Format

```bash
$PYTHON -m ruff format .
```

- Formats all `.py` files in place (replaces black + isort)
- To preview changes without applying:
  ```bash
  $PYTHON -m ruff format --diff .
  ```

### Step 4 — Run Type Checking (optional)

Ask the user if they want type checking. If yes:

```bash
$PYTHON -m mypy .
```

Or for stricter checking:

```bash
$PYTHON -m mypy --strict .
```

See `references/python-linter-reference.md` for mypy configuration options.

### Step 5 — Report Results

Summarise:
- How many lint issues were auto-fixed
- Any remaining issues that need manual attention (with file + line references)
- Formatting changes applied
- Type errors found (if mypy was run)

If issues remain, explain each one clearly and offer to fix them.
