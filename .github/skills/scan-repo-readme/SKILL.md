# Scan Repo README

Efficiently locate and extract information from repository README files using a haiku-model agent with minimal context. The agent performs dual-phase search (keyword + semantic), writes results to a timestamped file, and the main agent reads and presents the findings.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Find README Files

Run this exact Bash command — it auto-detects the `.venv` interpreter before invoking the script:

```bash
[ -d .venv ] || python -m venv .venv
PYTHON=$(if [ -f .venv/Scripts/python ]; then echo .venv/Scripts/python; else echo .venv/bin/python; fi)
$PYTHON .github/skills/scan-repo-readme/scripts/find-readmes.py
```

The script prints to stdout:
- **Line 1**: output file path (e.g., `.scan-readme-results/readme-scan-20240315-143022.md`)
- **Line 2+**: absolute paths of all README files found

If Bash is unavailable, use Glob with patterns `**/README.md`, `**/readme.md`, `**/README.rst`, `**/README.txt`, `**/README` and build the output path manually from the current timestamp.

### Step 2 — Launch Haiku Subagent

Use the Agent tool with:
- **subagent_type**: `"general-purpose"` (needs Write access to create the output file)
- **model**: `"haiku"` (falls back to inherited session model if unavailable)
- **description**: `"Scan README files"`

Pass only the necessary context — no conversation history. Construct the prompt as follows:

```
You are a README scanner. Read the listed files and write a structured report to the output file.
For any Python execution, always use `.venv` — create it if missing:
`[ -d .venv ] || python -m venv .venv`
`PYTHON=$(if [ -f .venv/Scripts/python ]; then echo .venv/Scripts/python; else echo .venv/bin/python; fi)`

README files to scan:
{paste file paths from Step 1, one per line}

Output file path: {paste output path from Step 1}

User query: {user's search term, or "full summary" if no query provided}

---

WHEN A QUERY IS PROVIDED — use dual-phase search:

PHASE 1 — KEYWORD SEARCH:
- Use the Grep tool on the README files to find lines containing the query keywords
- Also search for synonym groups from references/search-patterns.md
  (e.g., query "install" → also search "setup", "requirements", "dependencies")
- Collect matching lines with file path, line number, and ±3 lines of surrounding context

PHASE 2 — SEMANTIC SEARCH:
- Split each README into sections by headings (H1/H2/H3)
- For each section, assess semantic relevance to the query (even without exact keyword matches)
- Score: HIGH = directly answers the query, MEDIUM = related context, LOW = tangential

COMBINE RESULTS:
- Priority order: HIGH keyword+semantic → HIGH semantic-only → keyword-only
- Quote directly from source with file path and heading
- Deduplicate overlapping sections

WHEN NO QUERY — provide a structured summary for each README:
- Project name and one-line description
- Key features / capabilities
- Installation / setup steps
- Usage examples
- Configuration options
- License

WRITE THE REPORT:
Use the Write tool to create the output file directly. Do NOT return the report as a message.
File path: {output path from Step 1}
Format: Markdown
  - H1: "# README Scan Report" with query, date, file count
  - H2: relevance tier (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW)
  - H3: file path of each match
  - Body: direct quotes with surrounding context
```

### Step 3 — Read and Present

Read the timestamped output file and present the findings clearly and concisely to the user.
